I am interested in the social and political implications of technology, and in particular of digital technologies. I believe that technology can and should be an emancipatory force but that it requires a relevant contextualization and a multidisciplinary approach.

I have been active in the web industry for the last 10 years, and an advocate for open technology. I have always been committed to exploring how my skills can be used to foster a more engaged and participatory relationship between people using technology, in the spirit of an open source culture.

After a BA in international relations (Geneva University) and an MA in Technology Governance and Innovation (TalTech, Estonia), I am aiming to use my technical expertise, combined with social science methods, to approach these issues at a governance and practical level.
