I am interested in the social and political implications of technology, with a main focus in digital technologies. I believe technology can and should be an emancipatory force that requires a relevant contextualization and a multidisciplinary approach.

I have been active in the web industry for the past ten years as an advocate for open technology, and I have always been committed to exploring how my skills can be used to foster more engaged and participative relationships between people using technology in the spirit of an open-source culture.

After a BA in international relations (Geneva University) and an MA in Technology Governance and Innovation (TalTech, Estonia), My working methodology combines my technical expertise, with social science methods, to approach relevant socio-technical issues at a governance and practical level.
