This paper explores whether [SBB](https://www.sbb.ch/) can spare energy by renouncing its first class. SBB currently offers two classes on intercity trains. A first-class ticket is twice the price of the second-class ticket for the same travel. The first-class passenger cars have a lower number of seats and potentially different occupancy. Through different scenarios, we will analyse how this difference in price and seat density between the first and second classes can affect the energy consumption by people transported on the intercity line between Zurich and Geneva.
